title: "About CDR続"
---

CDR続 was born out of my personal dissatisfaction with spreadsheet software for storing detailed information.
Spreadsheets excel[^excel] in storing structured information, but fall short with unstructured and granular details.
*CDR続* here is a wordplay, referencing *complementarity-determining region* (CDR) on BCR/antibody, where the third region (CDR3) is the most crucial for mediating antigen recognition.

Breaking down the name,

- **Compiled documentation**, because here I am compiling information on monoclonal antibodies from literature into simpler digestible form.
- **Resolved**, where I am mostly interested in monoclonals with resolved epitope, i.e. we know where exactly they bind at on antigens they recognize.
- **Reactive**, meaning that the monoclonals are functional because they react to antigen and exhibit functional activity.
- **Repertoires**, i.e. *immune repertoire*.

CDR続 mostly contains monoclonal antibodies isolated from human samples.
Additionally, there is a page on monoclonal antibodies for flow cytometry that I have validated and used for immunophenotyping (see: [Flow Antibodies]({{< ref "/extras/flow_ab.md" >}})), and also a page for a list of influenza hemagglutinins (HAs) that are commonly used in influenza research (see: [Influenza Hemagglutinins]({{< ref "/extras/flu_ha.md" >}})).
These monoclonals are not listed on the main index page because they are mostly animal-derived and often do not have crystal structure deposited to PDB, and most likely patented[^patentdoc].

I would like to thank my PhD advisors, Drs. David J. Topham and Mark Y. Sangster for mentoring me (2019--2022), and members of Topham Lab at the David H. Smith Center for Vaccine Biology and Immunology (CVBI), Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Rochester.

[^patentdoc]: Patent documents would have the sequence, and it is not *that* difficult to find.
