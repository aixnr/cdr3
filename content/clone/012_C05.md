C05 is a unique monoclonal antibody, neutralizing multiple influenza subtypes by recognizing influenza receptor-binding site (RBS) pocket.
It has a long 24-amino acid CDR3 (heavy chain), and shown to neutralize H1, H2, H3, and H9 subtypes but no activity against H5 and some H1 viruses.
**Table 1** contains useful information on C05 activities (binding & neutralization), along with previously characterized monoclonal antibodies **CR6261** (anti-group 1) and **CR8020** (anti-group 2).

The paper describes an interesting affinity/avidity profile of C05:

> Indeed, C05 IgG binds to an array of immobilized HA with much higher affinity (nM to ∼pM levels) than its Fab...

... therefore, suggesting that C05 activity relies upon avidity through simultaneous engagement of both arms of C05 IgG.
