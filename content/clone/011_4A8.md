4A8 has a single-digit ng/mL EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit protein, but no reactivity against RBD.
It binds to N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 region and exhibits neutralizing activity against Wuhan-Hu-1 ancestral strain, and it recognizes VOCs Alpha, Gamma, Kappa, and Delta.
It does not neutralize Omicron VOC due to Δ144-145 deletion[^ntddel].
